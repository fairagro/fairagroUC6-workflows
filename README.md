# FAIRagro UC6 Crop Simulation Modelling Workflows

## Introduction

The repository contains computational workflows for crop simulation modelling created using the [FAIRagro Scientific Workflow Infrastructure (SciWIn)](https://github.com/fairagro/sciwin) tool.

### Requirements

To run the workflows, the following tools should be running on your system

1. [raster2sensor](https://github.com/tum-gis/raster2sensor) to process UAV images vegetation indices
2. [phenocover](https://github.com/tum-gis/phenocover) for phenology and ground cover estimation
3. [uc6_csmTools](https://github.com/leroy-bml/uc6_csmTools) ETL functions for semi-automated data integration into crop simulation modelling
